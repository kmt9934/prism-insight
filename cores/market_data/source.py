"""What a market data provider has to offer, and how several are combined.

The protocol is written from what the reports actually ask for, not from any
one provider's API. That is deliberate: define the port by the need and each
provider becomes an adapter, so adding a broker means writing one class rather
than editing every call site.

No provider covers everything. FinanceDataReader has no investor flows; a broker
may have flows but no index history. Rather than returning something plausible
but wrong, a source declares a capability unsupported and the chain moves on —
which is also how a caller learns that nobody can answer, instead of receiving
an empty frame that renders as a blank chart.
